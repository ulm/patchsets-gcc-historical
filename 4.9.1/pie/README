This work started with bugs #94325 #100689 #106222 #149292 #149649 and the overlay on http://overlays.gentoo.org/dev/kevquinn.
By Kevin K. Quinn, Peter S. Mazinger, Natanael Copa, Alexander Gabert, Solar, PaX Team, Mike Frysinger and mentor.

The work stalled. Some threads on the Gentoo forum started to do their own fixes to get it working.
Xake started the thread where most of the new work was done: "How long until hardened and toolchain will produce a hardened gcc4?"
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-668885.html. I joined the thread and started to code.

We started with the pieworld code from kevquinn's overlay. The PIE and minispecs part hit the tree later on.
With GCC 4.4.0 I was willing to do some code cleanup, use built-in specs and add it as --enable-esp in the
configure command line. On GCC 4.8.0 we use DRIVER_SELF_SPECS for the specs.
From Gcc 4.9.0 it will have -fstack-protector-strong on as default.

Thank you all:
