Patching configure:

During a system bootstrap autoconf may not be installed yet.  If you need to
patch configure.ac you also need to regenerate configure.  Look in the
configure header to get the version of autoconf it was generated with, install
it, and run autoconf in the directory of the configure.ac you patched.
