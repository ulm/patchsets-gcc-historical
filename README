##_all_[arch]_[PR]_[GCCVER]_my-desc.patch

(use GCCVER for backports to indicate what version the bug will be fixed in)


Documention
-----------
All patches need a header describing what the patch does, where it came from,
and all relevent URLs.  Read http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/clean-patches and
in particular use scrub_patch() or face the wrath.

Update README.history whenever you add (+), remove (-), or update (U) a patch.


Patching configure
------------------
During a system bootstrap autoconf may not be installed yet.  If you need to
patch configure.ac you also need to regenerate configure.  Look in the
configure header to get the version of autoconf it was generated with, install
it, and run autoconf in the directory of the configure.ac you patched.
